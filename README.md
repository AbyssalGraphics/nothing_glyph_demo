#NOTHING Phones Glyphs simple demo

This program just play a littl animation on Nothing Phones Glyphs

Just to see how to simply use Ketchum Library, as there seems to be som strange behaviour when I tried, like the toggle doesn't seems to turn off glyphs from previous frames.
And also, the builder.buildChannel(channel: Int, light: Int) doesn't seems to be in documentation, but it's the more efficient way to be sure of wich glyphs are turned on and off.
