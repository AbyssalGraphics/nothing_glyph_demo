#NOTHING Phones Glyphs simple demo


This program plays a little animation on Nothing Phones' Glyphs.

It's just to show how to simply use the Ketchum Library, as there seem to be some strange behaviors when I tried, like the toggle doesn't seem to turn off glyphs from previous frames.
Also, builder.buildChannel(channel: Int, light: Int) doesn't seem to be in the documentation, but it's the most efficient way to ensure which glyphs are turned on and off.
